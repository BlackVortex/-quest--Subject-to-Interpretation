-quest--Subject-to-Interpretation
=================================

hello everyone,
there is a quest that you should summ the image of darakuru  at the drakuru braizer,
even after collecting 5 Frozen Mojo's. 
It does not consume the mojo's and you dont have another way to finish the quest
because there is not way to summ the spirit of darakuru.
